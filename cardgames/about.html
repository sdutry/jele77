          <p>I do love card games. It all started long ago in December 2014, when I was bored during Xmas holidays and started playing Hearthstone. I was a total Noob and averaged 4 wins in Arena, which wasn't too bad for a total Beginner. I kinda started to play daily and in the end I could make it to legend regularly, could win two smaller 32 people tournaments and my average in Arena was something like 6.8. My best result however was a Top 100 (add link) finish in July 17 in wild , in a month I was so fed up with design decisions of the team, that I could not play regular ladder anymore and shortly after I quit.</p>

          <p>September 2017 I started playing TES:legends. I loved how active the design team was and I loved their smaller but very competitive tournaments. Especially the Top 32 tournament was a huge motivation for me and I wanted to get better to qualify for those. In November 2017 ReiReiBarker and I started a Team "The Listeners" together and our werewolf warrior deck got me to the Top for one day and was good enough for a Top 10 finish in the end. In December 2017 I won my first tournament (link), in April 2018 my second and in October 2018 I could get to #1 for the first time and finish top 10 (link).</p>

          <p>It was a hell of a ride and a shock, when Bethesda announced Maintenance mode in December 2019. The only regret I have now, that I could show my best form in both Masters qualifier, but overall I am thankful for all the experience I gained and the good times I had. I will still be playing TES:legends from time to time, it is a very good game, just badly managed and marketed.</p>

          <p>What will I play next? I really do enjoy MtG:Arena and Fatal Core currently and I am probably trying out more and more new cardgames, especially smaller tournaments I find the most fun.</p>
